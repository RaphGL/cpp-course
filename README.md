# cpp-course
Online form of my programming course.  

So far, the setup and basic C++ sections are complete, and the SDL2 section is in progress.
I will be adding lessons on the C++11 STL over the coming months.  
In the future, I may add data structures, as well as 3D libraries such as OpenGL or D3D and associated math.
