# cpp-course

This repository houses the online content of my programming courses I & II, including notes, exercises, projects, syllabi, etc.

So far, the environment setup, beginner/intermediate C++, SDL2, and a portion of the data structures lessons are complete.
Each lesson provides an overview of the topic, example code, programming exercises, and often diagrams.  

The website was personally designed and produced with an emphasis on clarity and speed&mdash;I'll update the design to better reflect the moden web sometime in the future.  

The frequency of updates may fall considerably after May 2017, as I will be leading a different style of course in the 2017-18 year. This course will focus more on the project management, teamwork, and design side of a classwide technical project.
